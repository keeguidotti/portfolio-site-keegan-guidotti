        <h2>Understanding The User</h2>
        <h3>The Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          User Design is not an end-goal, but rather it is a long-term process
          and utilising the Double Diamond Strategy allows everyone to have a
          defined value structure with definitive points along the path so that all
          members of the multidisplinary team know where the project stands at any given time.
          To start Phase 1: Research (design the right thing), I needed a catalyst to ignite the
          thinking process. This being the problem statement, which encapsulates identifying our
          persona, problem and goals.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Mindfulness & Selfcare</h3>
        <p>
          Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and stress have been increasing many
          countries due to event over recent years. Mindfulness-based interventions can be an
          evidence-based treatment for individuals with such struggles. However, mental health is
          such a personalised experience, possible problems can arise when designing an app to meet these needs.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Possible Problems</h3>
        <p>
          Consitancy: Mental health and its impact on an individuals mental, emotional and
          physical can significantly hinder one's ability to remain consistent
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumer Education: Mental health is a broad and complex topic that can present
          differently person to person. And knowing where to start selfcare and mindfulness
          can be overwhelming
        </p>
        <p>
          Design: The mental load of individuals accessing an app could already be quite heavy.
          To help reduce this mental load the design of the app needs be intuitive as possible
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Care Clinic is a responsive web app for individuals experiencing mental health,
          who need a way to facilitate informed self reflection and promote practicing selfcare
          strategies because they want to a holistic approach to their health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple Journaling: complete mood journal in a minimal number of clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resources: access educational content for informed decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feedback: weekly and monthly statistics of mood and activities completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customisation: like and save resources, add activities, change moods

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews in order to get
          a better understanding of the problem. Research points included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>what do users understand about mental health</li>
          <li>what do users understand about selfcare</li>
          <li>how are users completing selfcare</li>
          <li>what apps are they already using</li>
          <li>what obstacles are between the user and completing selfcare</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Users has some understanding about mental health through their own experiences,
          but wanted to expand their knowledge. Allocating time for self care was a large
          hurtle for many and core features wanted by the target audience included mood tracking,
          journaling and an educational tool.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the interviews of 5 people, I set up a proto-persona. I referred to them
          throughout the entire product development process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a deep understanding of the target audience is fundamental to creating a
          memorable and exceptional experience. Having a proto-persona helped me answer the important
          question of "who am I designing for?" By understanding the expectations, concerns and motivations
          of my target users, I can design an experience and product that will satisfy users' needs and
          therefore be successful.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>User Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I mapped out the prospective usersâ€™ steps with the insight I gained from my proto-persona to
          see how I could simplify their journey to help them reach their most important goals with the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that the journal entry feature would be the most used core feature of Care Clinic so I wanted to
          quickly identify possible pain points in the flow of this feature. Additionally, creating a user journey map
          allowed me to identify the users' needs, possible interactions and emotions throughout their experience
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Foundational Design</h2>
        <p>
          With the research completed, I could move onto illustrating the technical articulation of Care Clinics
          information architecture by creating a site map and subsequent varies iterations of my prototype.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Site Maps and Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>
          With an idea of how the user might navigate through Care Clinic, I needed to get more of an idea of the
          overall layout.
          I utilised open card sorting to evaluate and generate ideas for the information architecture of a product or
          service.
          From the feedback of participants, I then refined my sitemap into a more intuitive and constructed layout.
