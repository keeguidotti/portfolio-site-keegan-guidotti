        <h2>Project Type</h2>
        <p>
          A solo project completed through the UX design Course from Career Foundry.
          The project was one of 3 to choose from and I chose this one due to my background
          in nursing and personal experience with mental health.

        <p>
          Allow health-conscious individuals to log in to a responsive health and wellbeing portal
          to record their health and medical information, and access general physical and mental
          wellbeing features.

        <h3>The Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          User Design is not an end-goal, but rather it is a long-term process
          and utilising the Double Diamond Strategy allows everyone to have a
          defined value structure with definitive points along the path so that all
          members of the multidisplinary team know where the project stands at any given time.
          To start Phase 1: Research (design the right thing), I needed a catalyst to ignite the
          thinking process. This being the problem statement, which encapsulates identifying our
          persona, problem and goals.

        <h4>Mindfulness & Selfcare</h4>
        <p>
          Mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and stress have been increasing many
          countries due to event over recent years. Mindfulness-based interventions can be an
          evidence-based treatment for individuals with such struggles. However, mental health is
          such a personalised experience, possible problems can arise when designing an app to meet these needs.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h4>Possible Problems</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Consitancy</b>: Mental health and its impact on an individuals mental, emotional and
          physical can significantly hinder one's ability to remain consistent
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consumer Education</b>: Mental health is a broad and complex topic that can present
          differently person to person. And knowing where to start selfcare and mindfulness
          can be overwhelming
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Design</b>: The mental load of individuals accessing an app could already be quite heavy.
          To help reduce this mental load the design of the app needs be intuitive as possible
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
          Care Clinic is a responsive web app for individuals experiencing mental health,
          who need a way to facilitate informed self reflection and promote practicing selfcare
          strategies because they want to a holistic approach to their health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Simple Journaling</b>: complete mood journal in a minimal number of clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Resources</b>: access educational content for informed decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Feedback</b>: weekly and monthly statistics of mood and activities completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Customisation</b>: like and save resources, add activities, change moods

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p>
          At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews in order to get
          a better understanding of the problem. Research points included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>what do users understand about mental health</li>
          <li>what do users understand about selfcare</li>
          <li>how are users completing selfcare</li>
          <li>what apps are they already using</li>
          <li>what obstacles are between the user and completing selfcare</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Users has some understanding about mental health through their own experiences,
          but wanted to expand their knowledge. Allocating time for self care was a large
          hurtle for many and core features wanted by the target audience included mood tracking,
          journaling and an educational tool.

            Based on the interviews of 5 people, I set up a proto-persona. I referred to them
            throughout the entire product development process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a deep understanding of the target audience is fundamental to creating a
            memorable and exceptional experience. Having a proto-persona helped me answer the important
            question of "who am I designing for?" By understanding the expectations, concerns and motivations
            of my target users, I can design an experience and product that will satisfy users' needs and
            therefore be successful.

            I knew that the journal entry feature would be the most used core feature of Care Clinic so I wanted to
            quickly identify possible pain points in the flow of this feature. Additionally, creating a user journey map
            allowed me to identify the users' needs, possible interactions and emotions throughout their experience

            With the research completed, I could move onto illustrating the technical articulation of Care Clinics
            information architecture by creating a site map and subsequent varies iterations of my prototype.

            With an idea of how the user might navigate through Care Clinic, I needed to get more of an idea of the
            overall layout.
            I utilised open card sorting to evaluate and generate ideas for the information architecture of a product or
            service.
            From the feedback of participants, I then refined my sitemap into a more intuitive and constructed layout.

              I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireframes. This is the way I iterate through many

              options quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the rapid prototyping I decided to focus on three main features of the app. These features are
              integral
              to
              the full
              experience of the app and each one helps a user complete their goal.

                corelating
                mood and activities.</li>
              <li><b>Content</b>: access peer-reviewed and academic educational content so users can make informed

              <p>
                As this was my first project as a UX Designer,
                I have learnt a lot about how I design and what I can do to improve and really shine through in the
                future
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that I tend to dwell on my designs, especially in the first iterations, hoping they will be
                perfect.
                But I know now that is not the job of the first iteration and I should focus on quickly getting down
                my
                ideas
                and move on to the next steps as soon as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                User research can be the make or break of a project. Without a good knowledge foundation on who the
                product
                and experience is for, avoidable hurdles ae likely to occur and the user will not be the focus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having other designers to bounce ideas off can really change the a good design into an excellent
                design.
                Going forward, I will endeavour to reach out to my peers to get a fresh look on my design as well as
                specialised expertise.
